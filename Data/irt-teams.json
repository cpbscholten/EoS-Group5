Both teams follow the same documented response processes.  The Security Operations team are responsible for detecting and responding to incidents having to do with systems and infrastructure in both the corporate fleet and Slack’s backend. These teams are primarily responsible for detecting and responding to unwanted activity and actively exposed vulnerabilities in endpoints.  The Product Security team is responsible for the Secure Development Lifecycle and Bug Bounty programs which often identify vulnerabilities in the product, itself, such as a vulnerable library, code practice, or design. Where deemed incident-worthy, the Product Security team is responsible for acting as the subject matter expert and responding to such an incident to closure.",
